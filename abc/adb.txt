*>Query Processing And Query Optimization:- because ordbms used adts and structure objects , it will used new functionalities for processing a query which increase the efficiecy of query .A query processing in ordms include two functionality issue use define aggrigate and security method. A query processing in ordbms also include two issues which can increase efficiency of a query such as metho caching and pointer swizzling.
>User define aggrigates or aggrigation function:-Since users are allowed to define new methods for there adts .A normal query language such as sql include function such as count(),sum(),avg(),min(),max() etc.These methods are not suitable for image type and video type in ordbms .
Most ordbms alloow users to generate their own method with the system.To register an aggrigation method or function.A user implement three methods that is initialize,itrate and terminate.The initialize method initialize the internal state for the aggrigation method .The itrate method update that state for  the every tuple .And the terminate method compute the aggrigation result based on the final state.
>Method Secuity:- because an ordbms include adts methods , it is important for the machanism to exist to write a bug free code before registering their methods one solution provide security is that use interprater rather then a compiler.second solution is to allow user methods  to be compiled by using a general purpose langu such as C  but run those method in a different address space.
>Method Caching :- user adts methods can be very expansive to execution and can take a large time to process  a query by using method caching the result of a method can be cached to speed up the qury processing.A cache of method can be maintain as a table in the database and when we have to search a method ,we need to search cache only .It will save time and decrease the cost too.     
>Pointer swizzling:-An ordbms is based on objects and object is stored with the help of object id when an object O is brought into mempoy they check each oid which point out an object O and replace of oid  in memory object by memory pointer to those object this techanics is called pointer swizzling .
*>query Optimization:-means to find out the best solution among all solution which will take less time or cost to perform a query on a database because an ordbms includes ADTs and structure objects.A query optimizer is requiored to handle the new qurey processing functionality .A query optimizer in ordbms includes new indexes a adts methos esstimation and expamsive seletion methob optimization tech.
>registering and indexes with optimizer cost estimation for adts method :-As new indexes are edit to system such as Gist ,the optimizer must be inform ther existing and there cost of access for given index structure , the optimizer must know" what WHERE cluse cond are match by that index "And "what tyhe cost of fatching a tuple for that index" diff pordbms Vary in the syntex registering new index structur.
> cost estimation of adts method :-As adts methods can be quite expansive at it is important for the optimizer to know just how much these method  cost to execute such estimation is hard for user to do aquratily .alternative sulutionis to run the method on object of vaiouse size and attempt to estimate the method cost automaticaly.
